#RestSharp
RestSharp is a C# based library that is used to test RESTful Web Services. 
This library behaves like a headless Client to access REST web services. 
We can create highly customizable HTTP Requests to send to the Restful server. 
This enables us to test a wide variety of Request combinations and in turn test different combinations of core business logic.
